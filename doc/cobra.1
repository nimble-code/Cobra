.SH SYNOPSIS
.br
.B cobra
.BI [ options ]
.BI [ files ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\*C supports the examination and exploration of sets
of source files that have been preprocessed into lexical tokens.
The tool supports queries expressed interactively in direct
query commands, and it can handle more detailed queries with
inline programs written in a special scripting language.
.br
By default the tool recognizes C keywords and typenames.
With command-line
options it can also recognize C++, Java, Ada or Python code.
The tool can be retargeted for additional languages, or
other types of input not related to programming, by defining
maps of the types of tokens that must be recognized.
The query command and scripting language
are documented in online reference manuals.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-Ada
Recognize Ada keywords.
.TP
.B \-allheaderfiles
Process all headerfiles, including system header files
starting with prefix \f3/usr/\f1. Assumes that \f3\-cpp\f1 is used.
See also \f3\-noheaderfiles\f1.
.TP
.B \-C++
Recognize C++ keywords.
.TP
.BI "\-commands \f2'commands'\f1"
Execute query \f2commands\f1, and then stop.
Individual query commands are separated by semi-colons.
See also \f3\-e\f1. Can be abbreviated to \f3\-c\f1
.br
Implies also option \f3\-quiet\f1.
.TP
.B \-cpp
Run the C preprocessor over the input files before scanning them.
This can later be undone with the inline command \f2cpp off\f1.
If preprocessing was not enabled at startup (the default), it can
also be enabled interactively with command \f2cpp on\f1, which then
triggers a rescan of all source files.
.TP
.B \-d
Reserved for debugging support.
Different behavior when preceded with \f3\-v\f1.
Implies \f3\-preserve\f1.
.TP
.B \-Dstr
Pass directive to the C preprocessor.
See also \f3\-cpp\f1, \f3\-U\f1 and \f3\-I\f1.
.TP
.BI "\-expr \f2'token_expression'\f1
(Alternatively: \f3-e\f1, see also \f3-pattern\f1) Report (sequences of) lines matching a token expression.
Meta-symbols that can be used in token expressions, with the usual meaning, are:
(, |, ), ., *, +, ?.
.br
Sets of tokens can also be written as ranges enclosed in square brackets, e.g.:
\f2[ appel pear ]\f1, to indicate a required match of any token in the range
at the corresponding place in the expression.
A token-name and a range of token-names (but not sub-expressions) can be negated
with a ^ symbol, e.g.:
\f2^appel\f1 (to indicate a required match any token except the one negated) or
\f2^[appel pear]\f1 (to match any token not named in the range).
.br
See also \f3-pattern\f1, for a simplified version of this option.
.br
Tokens can be bound to a variable name with a name-binding operation \f2name:pattern\f1,
e.g. \f2name:@ident\f1,
and later referenced with a name-reference \f2:name\f1.
.br
When preceded by option \f3\-view\f1, a graph of the non-deterministic
finite state automaton that is generated from the token expression is displayed with
\f2dot\f1 (which is assumed to be installed).
.br
Implies also option \f3\-quiet\f1.
.TP
.BI "-f \f2file\f1"
Execute the commands stored in the named \f2file\f1, and then stop.
.br
Implies also option \f3\-quiet\f1.
.\" .TP
.\" .B \-g
.\" Reserved for future gui support.
.TP
.B \-help
(or any other unrecognized option like \f3\-?\f1 or \f3\-\-\f1)
print a summary of command line arguments.
.TP
.B \-Idir
Pass directive to the C preprocessor.
See also \f3\-cpp\f1, \f3\-D\f1 and \f3\-U\f1.
.TP
.B \-Java
Recognize Java keywords.
.TP
.B \-lib
List all prefefined \*C query sets that can be invoked by name
with the \f3\-f\f1 option, without or without the filename suffix \f2.cobra\f1.
This option can be abbreviated to \f3\-l\f1.
.TP
.B \-macros
Parse the text of preprocessing macros,
instead than classifying each complete macro definition
as a single lexical token of type \f2cpp\f1.
The use of this option implies that no C preprocessing is used
(which is the default), cf. \f3\-cpp\f1, \f3\-nocpp\f1.
This option can be abbreviated to \f3\-m\f1.
.br
Can be abbreviated to \f3\-m\f1.
.TP
.B \-nocpp
Do not invoke the C preprocessor (the default),
and prevent preprocessing from being enabled interactively,
with <tt>cpp on</tt> commands (e.g., in scripts).
See also \f3\-cpp\f1.
.br
Can be abbreviated to \f3\-n\f1.
.TP
.B \-noqualifiers
Do not tag C qualifiers separately (e.g., const, volatile).
.TP
.B \-noheaderfiles
Do not process any files with names ending in \f3.h\f1.
See also \f3\-allheaderfiles\f1.
.TP
.B \-notypedefs
Do not process C typedef definitions. By default the typedefs are
parsed and the resulting user-defined types are categorized as \f2@type\f1.
.TP
.B \-notypes
Do not tag any predefined C type names (e.g., int, short, char)
.TP
.B \-Nn
Use \f2n\f1 parallel threads to process queries.
.\" On Linux systems with at least four cores, the default setting
.\" that is used will be \f3\-N4\f1, unless an explicit \f2Nn\f1 argument is used.
.TP
.BI "\-pattern \f2'token_expression'\f1
(Alternatively \f3-pat\f1) Behaves like \f3-expr\f1 but with a
spimlified token expression format that requires fewer escape symbols.
In a pattern expression the characters '(', '|', ')', '+', and '?' are always
interpreted as regular characters and never as meta-symbols.
.br
The characters '*' and ']' are interpreted as
regular characters only if they are \f3preceded\f1 by a space,
and the character '[' is only interpreted as a regular
character if it is \f3followed\f1 by a space.
.br
The complete set of escape rules for pattern expressions is as follows:
.br
	':' is ':' iff preceded and followed by space, else it provides name binding
.br
	'[' is '[' iff followed by a space, else it begins a range expression
.br
	']' is ']' iff preceded by a space, else it closes a range expression
.br
	'*' is '*' iff preceded by a space, else it is the Kleene star
.br
	'.' is '.' iff preceded by '\\', else it matches any character
.br
	'^' is '^' iff preceded by '\\', else it indicates negation.
.TP
.B \-preserve
Preserve the temporary files created in \f2/tmp/cobra_*\f1.
.TP
.B \-Python
Recognize Python keywords.
.TP
.B \-quiet
Quiet mode.
Produces no intermediate output on matches and run-times.
.TP
.B \-runtimes
Report the runtime of all commands executed, if it exceeds one second.
.TP
.B \-scrub
Produce output in the format expected by the \f2scrub\f1 tool.
.TP
.B \-stdin
Read source files from stdin. Requires one of:
\f3\-commands\f1, \f3\-expr\f1, \f3-pattern\f1, or \f3\-f\f1.
.TP
.B \-terse
Suppress the display of detailed matches, showin only number of matches.
(Most useful in combination with \f3\-f\f1, \f3\-expr\f1, or \f3\-commands\f1.
.TP
.B \-tok
Produce a tokenized version of the source files and then stop.
.TP
.B \-Ustr
Pass directive to the C preprocessor.
See also \f3\-cpp\f1, \f3\-D\f1 and \f3\-I\f1.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose mode.
.TP
.B \-view
Must be followed by one of \f3\-expr\f1, \f3\-pattern\f1, or \f3\-f\f1.
.br
When combined with \f3\-expr\f1 or \f3\-pattern\f1, displays a dot-graph
of the NDFA of the token expression.
.br
When combined with \f3\-f file\f1 and the file contains a single inline
program, displays a dot-graph of the DFA of that program.
.br
The \f3\-view\f1 option implies \f3\-preserve\f1.
.TP
.BI "\-var name=value"
Set \f2name\f1 to \f2value\f1 in user-defined parameterized scripts.
.TP
.B \-version
Print current \*C version number and stop.
Can be abbreviated as \f3\-V\f1.

.SH EXAMPLES
In all example below the initial \f2$\f1 character is the shell
command prompt.
.PP
Print lines containing a match of lexical tokens
named \f2x\f1 (e.g., identifiers) in a set of C source files:
.RS
  $ cobra \-expr x *.[ch]
.RE
or just
.RS
  $ cobra \-e x *.[ch]
.RE
.PP
To print only the tokens matched:
.RS
  $ cobra \-commands "mark x; list" *.[ch]
.RE
or more compactly using shorthands:
.RS
  $ cobra \-c 'm x; l' *.[ch]
.RE
.PP
Display the complete source lines:
.RS
  $ cobra \-c 'm x; d' *.[ch]
.RE
.PP
Display the precise tokens matched:
.RS
  $ cobra \-c 'm x; p' *.[ch]
.RE
.PP
Print identifier names:
.RS
  $ cobra \-c 'm @ident; l' *.[ch]
.RE
.PP
Print tokens matching a regular expression:
.RS
  $ cobra \-c 'm /x; l' *.[ch]
.RE
.PP
Find switch statements without a default clause:
.RS
  $ cobra \-c 'm switch; n {; c top no default; d' *.c
.RE
.PP
Print every token preceded by its sequence number, with an
inline Cobra program fragment:
.RS
  $ cobra \-c '%{ print .seq " " .txt "\\n"; %}' *.c
.RE
Note that we use single quotes around the command, so that
we can use double-quotes inside, in the print statement.
.PP
Find functions that open, but do not close, a file descriptor, using a
token expression:
.RS
  $ cobra \-e '{ FILE \\* x:@ident .* :x = fopen ^fclose* }' *.c
.RE
By default, the nesting
level of closing curly, round, and square braces are matched to the
last preceding opening brace of the same type and level.
.LP
This can be written more compactly with the \f3\-pattern\f1 option:
.RS
  $ cobra \-pattern '{ FILE * x:@ident .* :x = fopen ^fclose* }' *.c
.RE
or also
.RS
  $ cobra \-pat '{ FILE * x:@ident .* :x = fopen ^fclose* }' *.c
.RE
Pattern commands are usable for most simple pattern queries,
and easier to type as well,
so we'll use them for most of the examples.
.PP
Find memory that is allocated but not freed within the same block:
.RS
  $ cobra \-pat '{ .* malloc ^free* }' *.c
.RE
.PP
Find switch statements that do not contain a default clause
with a token expression, though possibly matching defaults in nested statements
(see above for a more precise command sequence using -c):
.RS
  $ cobra \-pat 'switch ( .* ) { ^default* }' *.c
.RE
.PP
Find cases where a loop-control variable is used inside the body of a for-loop
(easy to adapt to suffix with an assignment operator or pre- or post-increment
or decrement operators, to check if the variable is modified as well):
.RS
  $ cobra \-pat 'for ( x:@ident .* ) { .* :x .* }' *.c
.RE
.PP
Find if statements not followed by compound statement:
.RS
  $ cobra \-pat 'if ( .* ) ^{' *.c
.RE
.PP
Be careful with the dot meta-symbol when it is used in combination
with negations in the same expression. In the above expression,
for instance, it is sometimes better to write:
.RS
  $ cobra \-pat 'if ( ^)* ) ^{' *.c
.RE
.PP
Find else keywords that are not followed by compound statement or another if:
.RS
  $ cobra \-pat 'else ^[{ if]' *.c
.RE
.PP
Find empty if statements:
.RS
  $ cobra \-pat 'if ( .* ) ;' *.c
.RE
.PP
Note that in this pattern expression the semi-colon symbol
at the end matches a lexical token. It is not a command separator, as
it would be if the \f3\-c\f1 syntax was used.
.PP
Find empty else clauses:
.RS
  $ cobra \-pat 'else ;' *.c
.RE
.PP
Find expressions with missing braces around (selected) binary operators:
.RS
  $ cobra \-pat '( ^(* [| &] ^(* & .* )' *.c
.RE
.PP
Find the definition of the C function \f2main\f1:
.RS
  $ cobra \-pat 'main ( .* ) { .* }' *.c
.RE
.PP
Find blocks that contain no semi-colons or commas, after standard
preprocessing with macro-substitution, file inclusion, etc:
.RS
  $ cobra \-cpp \-pat '{ ^[, ;]* }' *.c
.RE
.PP
Find calls to sprintf that potentially use the destination argument as a source:
.RS
  $ cobra \-pat 'sprintf ( x:@ident .* :x .* )' *.c
.RE
.PP
Also highlight the matching bound variable references:
.RS
  $ cobra \-v \-pat 'sprintf ( x:@ident .* :x .* )' *.c
.RE
.SH FILES
A directory with predefined query libraries is created in
\f2$COBRA/rules\f1, where \f2$COBRA\f1 is the installation directory.
(If you forgot, on a Unix/Linux system type: \f2'which cobra'\f1 to find it,
and replace the trailing \f2bin/cobra\f1 with \f2rules\f1.)
.PP
Files with extension \f2.cobra\f1 that are located
in subdirectory \f2$COBRA/rules/main\f1 can be invoked directly by
name from the command-line (without the need to specify a complete
pathname). For instance:
.RS
  $ cobra \-terse \-f basic.cobra *.[ch]
.RE
Or interactively as:
.RS
  : . basic
.RE
This command applies a set of checks defined in \f2$COBRA/rules/main/basic.cobra\f1.
With the \f2terse\f1 option only numbers of matches are reported, but not
detailed line-by-line reports.
Without the \f3\-terse\f1 option the full details are displayed.
See also option \f3\-lib\f1.
.PP
The file \f2$HOME/.cobra\f1 is created during tool installation and is read
when the tool is started. It contains the location of the rules directory
and can optionally define a default number of cores to use on each run.
Sample contents of this file are:
.RS
Rules: /tools/cobra/rules
.br
ncore: 1
.RE
There should be no space before the first \f2Rules:\f1 or \f2ncore:\f1 field,
and there should no no other information on a line after the second field.
There may be spaces or tabs between the first and second field.
.PP
Be careful with using a higher value for the default number of cores to be
used: not all predefined library checks are multi-core safe (yet).
.PP
Tool documentation can be found online at \f2http://spinroot.com/cobra\f1..
.br
Temporary files are created in \f2/tmp\f1 with all filenames prefixed
with the string \f2/tmp/cobra_\f1. With option \f2-d\f1 the temporary
files are not automatically removed when \*C exits.
