- allowing use of globals inside functions
- added a few cwe checkers

2.6 oct 2018

2.8 feb 2019
- added 'and' qualifier to contains command (and updated manpage)
- reduced cache misses in multi-core mode significantly

2.9 mar 2019
- fixed missing lock in code for "match()" in cobra_prog.y which could
  cause occassional segfaults when executing scripts in multicore mode

3.0 jun 2019
- extensions to the pattern language, allowing embedded regular
  expressions in pattern expressions
- new predefined functions that can be used in cobra scripts:
  reset(), fcts(), save(), restore(), marks()
- updated online manpages
- new library query files
- extension of command query save, to allow |,&, and ^ modifiers
- bug fixes and speedups for multi-core processing
- full source code and libraries released on github
- after initial release on github, made following updates:
  - fixed a line number bug where // style comments had a linenr
    attribute one too high
  - added C_TMP environment variable, explained in the main README.md
    relevant only to older cygwin/pc platforms where 'dot' otherwise
    can't find /tmp
  - corrected "malloc.h" -> "stdlib.h" for compilation on macs
  - made query commands 'context' and 'fcg' work correctly again
  - fixed bug with using cpp on/off interactively
  - created tagged commit for the final 3.0 version dated June 12 2019
    tag: version-3.0

3.1 nov 2019
  - correctly interpret a 'q' command when a script is read from a file
  - updated rules/play/taint.cobra
  - added checks to prevent null-ptr derefs
  - fixed reference to an out-of-scope variable, detected by coverity scan
  - fewer warnings about redefined labels when rerunning scripts
  - fixed bug with pattern searches that limited alternative choices of
    how bindings were applied
  - rewrote the encoding of associative arrays for the scripting language
    to make it considerably faster when dealing with larger arrays
  - added a -text option to suppress the categorization of tokens, which
    is especially useful when using cobra as a runtime verification tool
    on data other than program source text
  - revised how cobra reads data from stdin in no files are given. the
    data is now read in portions, so that cobra can maintain a sliding
    window on an event-stream, and check scripted queries, or pattern
    queries on a potentially infinite data stream (provided the memory
    requirements for the check remains bounded).
    by splitting the data-stream it is also possible to then check
    multiple properties in parallel.
  - many other small improvements and fixes in the query libraries, the
    main source code in src, and in the standalone checkers in src_app,
    especially in the standalone version of the cwe checkers, which are
    now all recoded to support multi-core checks
  - added online tutorials for the all existing capabilities of cobra
    verison 3.1, including the new runtime verification options.

3.2/3.3 sep 2020
  - added new find_taint backend module for finding cases of potential
    code injection in code bases.
  - reduced memory use and inproved runtime performance in processing
    streaming data, with revised token recycling.
  - added runtime and command-line options for defining the size of the
    moving event window (-stream) in applications of runtime verification.
  - added support for multi-script streaming in runtime verification.
    (earlier only a single script could be used)
  - added predefined functions for handling lists, queues, stack within Cobra scripts
  - improved accuracy of bracket-pairing across ifdef directives in C/C++ code,
    using a stack-based method for remembering settings across these directives.
  - better method for passing command-line arguments to backend modules,
    recognizing options preceded by a double dash, which are now passed to
    backend modules uninterpreted.
  - added support for the use of binary exclusive or (^), binary right-shift (>>),
    and binary left-shift (<<) operators in Cobra scripts.
  - added support for modifying additional token fields in Cobra scripts:
    specifically the fields: .round, .bracket, .curly, and .len, in addition
    to the already allowed fields .mark, .fnm, and .lnr.
  - increased the sizes of some arrays to prevent static analyzer warnings on
    potential buffer overflow.
  - added a compiler directive NO_SBRK option to support newer Mac & Linux platforms
    (preventing direct calls to the sbrk() system-routine).
  - added compiler directive DEBUG_MEM for generating diagnostic output on memory
    use during script executions.
  - additional small bug fixes.

3.4 feb 2021
  - further improvements in accuracy of brace pairing in pattern expressions (-pe)
  - new command-line options -F, -recursive, -eol, -eof
  - all warning and error messages now go to stderr instead of stdout
  - added -json and -json+ command line options primarily for output of -pe searches
  - new interactive query command dp to display selected pattern matches
  - updated manual pages
  - small bug fixes

3.4 march 5 2021
  - fixed bug in display of search results for option pe
  - fixed bug in fcts command when -m flag is used (parse macros)
  - added support of comparisons with .fct in expressions;
  - added the ability to define additional constraints, as general expressions
    on token attributes attached to states) in pattern-expression matching expressions
    (option pe) - to be documented

3.4 march 19 2021
  - changed working of command-line argument -comments to enable the inclusion
    of comments as tokens.  the full comment text is always included in the token
    (each comment forms a single token).  by default now comments are not included
    in the token stream. clearly, enabling preprocessing (-cpp) will void this option
    because the preprocessor will remove comments.
  - several other improvements and fixes in pattern expression matching
  - updated manual pages and tutoral pages with the changes

3.5 june 25 2021
  - bug fixes in pattern matching code (option -pe), especially
    when using choices in pattern expressions
  - bug fix in the input streaming mode
  - corrected implementation of the ft command (find-type)
  - new command: 'symbols' that tries to quickly link variables
    to the most likely location of their declaration
    with manpage (http://spinroot.com/cobra/commands/symbols.html)
  - modified working of reset command, to preserve link
    information set in the new symbols command
  - added token category @const as a shorthand for:
    @const_int, @const_hex, @const_oct, const_flt
    which are still supported
  - small fix in the find_taint command (better precision
    in reporting suspicious uses of gets())
  - extension of pattern expressions to allow positional
    parameters and the application of general constraints
    at different points in an expression

-- august 6 2021
  - new version of src_app/find_taint that now reads a
    user-definable configuration file -- added a manual
    page for this new backend tool as well.
    the new version is faster (though that wasn't the
    objective) and reports more things; it also has more
    easily understandable code (the main objective)
