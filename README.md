# Cobra
## An interactive static source code analyzer

Cobra is a fast code analyzer that can be used
to interactively probe and query up to millions of lines
of code. The basic design of the tool is language-neutral,
though a lot of query and rule libraries have been
developed, and are included in the distribution, that target
C or C-like languages. The original version of the tool
(version 1.0) was developed at NASA/JPL and cleared
for public release in April 2016. The current version (5.0)
is a significantly extended version of the tool,
released under the same license.

A comprehensive user guide to  the Cobra tool
will be published as a book this year (2025),
see [https://codescrub.com/cobra].

## Installation

* choose a directory to install the tool,
   below this is referred to as directory $COBRA
```
   $ git clone https://github.com/nimble-code/Cobra
   $ export COBRA=`pwd`
```
   which gives you a directory with a set of
   sub-directories like this:
```
   drwxrwxr-x 2 gh gh 4096 May 16 10:03 doc     # change history, manpage, license  
   drwxrwxr-x 2 gh gh 4096 May 16 10:03 gui     # optional small tcl/tk script  
   drwxrwxr-x 8 gh gh 4096 May 16 15:55 rules   # cobra checker libraries  
   drwxrwxr-x 1 gh gh 4096 May 16 12:43 src     # cobra source files  
   drwxrwxr-x 1 gh gh 4096 May 16 12:43 src_app # standalone cobra checkers
   drwxrwxr-x 1 gh gh 4096 May 16 12:43 bin_tools # platform independent support tools
```
* you can also download binaries from the last stable release of Cobra
  from the Releases tab -- they are in three .zip files with precompiled
  binaries of cobra and related tools for cygwin, linux, and mac.

* to compile the tool (if you are not using precompiled executables)
```
   $ cd src
```
   and depending on your platform, one of:
```
   $ sudo make all install	# linux
   $ make all install	# cygwin
   $ make mac install	# mac
```
* if you're using the precompiled executables, copy the right set to
  your local bin directory, which is /usr/local/bin

* configure the tool so that it knows where to find the rule libraries
  (using the $COBRA directory set at the beginning):
```
   $ cobra -configure $COBRA
```
   this creates a ~/.cobra file in your home directory, which
   cobra reads on startup to find the predefined checker libraries

   you can also tell Cobra where the libraries are by setting and
   exporting an environment variable C_BASE, for instance as follows:
```
     export C_BASE=$COBRA/rules
```
   if both a ~/.cobra file exists and the $C_BASE variable is set, the
   latter will be used.

* on ancient cygwin 32bit platforms you may also have to help cobra
  find where the /tmp directory for temporary files is located, e.g.
  to make the cobra -view -pe '...' option work with dot or dotty.
  to do so, add the following environment variable, for instance:
```
     export C_TMP=C:/cygwin64
```
